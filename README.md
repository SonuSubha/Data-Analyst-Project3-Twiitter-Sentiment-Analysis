# Data-Analyst-Project3-Twiitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project involves analyzing and predicting the sentiment of tweets using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to understand how people feel about various topics based on their tweets.

Project Overview
The project is divided into several key objectives:

Data Exploration:

Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, features, and size.
Identify important variables such as tweet content, timestamps, and sentiment labels.
Data Cleaning:

Clean the data by addressing missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant information.
Ensure the data is of high quality for accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform initial analysis to uncover patterns in tweet content and sentiment.
Use visualizations like histograms and word clouds to summarize key aspects of the data.
Sentiment Distribution:

Examine the distribution of sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).
Assess whether the dataset is balanced or if there are biases.
Word Frequency Analysis:

Analyze the frequency of words used in tweets to identify common themes.
Visualize frequent terms in positive and negative tweets using charts and word clouds.
Temporal Analysis:

Study how sentiment changes over time by looking at tweet timestamps.
Identify any significant patterns or trends in sentiment over different time periods.
Text Preprocessing:

Clean and prepare tweet text by removing stop words, special characters, and URLs.
Tokenize and lemmatize words to get the text ready for sentiment analysis.
Sentiment Prediction Model:

Build a machine learning model to predict tweet sentiment.
Train and evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy and F1 score.
Feature Importance:

Determine which words or phrases are most influential in predicting sentiment.
Use visualizations to show the importance of different features.
User Interface (Optional):

Develop a simple interface where users can input their own text for sentiment analysis.
Display the sentiment prediction results in a clear and user-friendly way.
Documentation:

Document the process, including data cleaning, model building, and findings.
Provide explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to help others understand the project.
Insights and Recommendations:

Summarize the main insights gained from the analysis.
Offer recommendations based on observed trends and model performance.

Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
Install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add the dataset:

Place the dataset in the data/ directory. Ensure it is named sentiment_dataset.csv.
Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

Open and execute the notebooks in the notebooks/ folder to perform the analysis.
(Optional) Launch the user interface:

If you have implemented a UI, you can start it with Streamlit:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run notebooks/09_User_Interface.ipynb
How to Use
Use the provided notebooks to explore and analyze the sentiment data.
Feel free to adapt the code for your own datasets or to add new features to the analysis.
If using the optional user interface, input text to see sentiment predictions in real time.
Results
The analysis highlights key sentiment trends, common themes, and the performance of the sentiment prediction model.
Insights from the analysis can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as monitoring public opinion or analyzing customer feedback.
